# Global Trade Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of international trade data using Python and data visualization libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Streamlit. The dashboard allows users to interactively explore trade trends, understand patterns, and gain insights into trade distribution across categories, countries, and years.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to understand the drivers of trade flow efficiency through the analysis of various trade components such as supplier behavior, payment terms, and order timing patterns. The study identifies key trends in international trade, uncovers trade flow dynamics, and assesses frequently traded goods. Additionally, it highlights seasonal and regional variations to derive actionable insights for optimizing trade operations.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit, the dashboard enables users to explore trade data by filtering through years, categories, and countries. Visualizations include bar charts, line charts, sunburst charts, scatter plots, and more.
- **Trade Analysis**: Provides insights into high-value products, top exporting and importing countries, seasonal trends, and payment term preferences.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employs statistical tests and summary statistics to explore trade patterns and relationships between variables.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, the project provides strategic recommendations for optimizing trade flows and identifying market opportunities.

## Dashboard Overview
To run the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Make sure you have all required dependencies installed:
